### Assignment 1: Replicate a website using HTML & CSS

In this assignment, you are required to build [this](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17061374/Assignment.1.Sample.1.pdf) website using HTML and CSS with a focus on Flexbox layout. Follow these steps to complete the assignment:

**1. Design and Layout:**

- Utilize Flexbox exclusively for designing the layout of your webpage. Ensure that no other layout methods or frameworks are used. While the colors and fonts in your design do not need to match the sample exactly, it is highly recommended that you use a color picker tool to select colors that closely resemble those used in the sample.

**2. File Structure:**

- HTML File: Create an HTML file named index.html. This file should contain all the necessary HTML code to build your webpage.
- CSS File: Create a CSS file named styles.css. This file should contain all the CSS code required to style your webpage.

**3. Deployment:**

- Deploy your website to GitHub Pages. Ensure that the webpage is accessible online through a GitHub Pages URL.
