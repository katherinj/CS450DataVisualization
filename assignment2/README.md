### Assignment 2: Replicate a website using React

In this assignment, you will utilize state and props in ReactJS to create the [resume website](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17061374/Assignment.1.Sample.1.pdf) by breaking it down into 1 parent component and 5 child components. All data will be stored in the parent component (App.js) and passed as props to the child components.

Note: You are not allowed to have any state variables in the child components, nor store any data in them.

**1. Components details:**

- App.js (Parent component)
- App.css (CSS file to set the layout and style both the parent and child components)
- Header.js (Child component for the header of the resume that display your name and contact information)
- PersonalProfile.js (Child component for the personal profile section)
- WorkExperience.js (Child component for the work experience section)
- Skills.js (Child component for the skills section)
- Education.js (Child component for the education section)

**2. Data Handling:**
In the App.js file, create a state object that holds all the data for the resume.
Pass the data from App.js to the child components as props.

**3. Deployment:** Deploy your website to GitHub Pages. Ensure that the webpage is accessible online through a GitHub Pages URL.
